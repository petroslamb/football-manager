# Kaggle Match Outcome Prediction in Football

The goal of this project is to predict match outcomes of European football matches more accurately than bookkeepers, thereby beating the odds and to, in the end, generate a positive return on investment. Based on the dataset provided on kaggle.com that includes basic match data, FIFA player statistics and bookkeeper data, I built a model to predict the probability of each match outcome â€“ win, draw, or defeat.
